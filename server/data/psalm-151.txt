Psalm 151

[1:1] This Psalm is a genuine one of David, though supernumerary, composed when he fought in single combat with Goliath. I was small among my brothers, and youngest in my father's house. I tended my father's sheep.
[1:2] My hands formed a musical instrument, and my fingers tuned a lute.
[1:3] Who shall tell my Lord? The Lord himself, he himself hears.
[1:4] He sent forth his angel and took me from my father's sheep, and he anointed me with his anointing oil.
[1:5] My brothers were handsome and tall; but the Lord did not take pleasure in them.
[1:6] I went out to meet the Philistine, and he cursed me by his idols.
[1:7] But I drew his own sword and beheaded him, and removed reproach from the children of Israel.
